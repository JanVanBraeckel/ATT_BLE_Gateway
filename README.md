# AllThingsTalk Bluetooth Low Energy Gateway

Gateway application made for Android which connects with Bluetooth Low Energy devices and syncs the data collected with the AllThingsTalk developer Cloud.

Project made for my thesis in fulfilment of a bachelor degree in Applied Computer Sciences at the University College Ghent.

# Disclaimer
This is definitely a work in progress and still has some bugs and crashes. If I ever find the time this will be made into a functioning first prototype, in the meantime feel free to submit pull requests and submit mean comments about how I could do things better.
